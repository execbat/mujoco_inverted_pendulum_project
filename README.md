# MuJoCo Inverted Pendulum Target  This project provides a **custom MuJoCo environment** where an agent controls an inverted pendulum.   The task is to **move the pole tip to a randomly spawned target** and **hold balance** near the target point.  The environment is designed for **training with PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**.
